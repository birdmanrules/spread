Calculus lets us start with �circumference = 2 * pi * r� and figure out the others � the Greeks would have appreciated this.

Teachers focused more on publishing/perishing than teaching
Self-fulfilling prophecies that math is difficult, boring, unpopular or �not your subject�
Textbooks and curriculums more concerned with profits and test results than insight
�A Mathematician�s Lament� [pdf] is an excellent essay on this issue that resonated with many people:

��if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child�s natural curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn�t possibly do as good a job as is currently being done � I simply wouldn�t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soul-crushing ideas that constitute contemporary mathematics education.�
Algebra finds entire sets of numbers � if you know a and b, you can find c. Calculus finds patterns between equations: you can see how one equation (circumference = 2 * pi * r) relates to a similar one (area = pi * r^2).
That�s great, but it can be hard to relate: honestly, how often do you know the equation for velocity for an object? Less than once a week, if that.
