Morality of Developers

Being a good developer is a moral dilemma. There are many parties a developer must please. Let us use the example of an online game developer. As a game developer, you must please your shareholders, your gaming community, your employees, and perhaps more. What exactly pleases each party? Shareholders obviously want more money, better margins, and low liability. The community probably wants good content released, timely patches, and good security. Employees want better pay, better working conditions, and longevity of the game for employment reasons. It's a tug of war in the business world, but character comes into play heavily.
	Whatever side you choose, in a way, reflects what your character is as a developer. Who do you feel that you owe the most to? Your fans, shareholders, or your employees? If you choose shareholders and subject your employees to lower pay, or your community to pricier content, you can be seen as greedy. Sometimes you need to increase prices for your company's sake, but at what point does this make you greedy? On the other hand, if you give content away for free, and don't have enough money to support your employees or shareholders, you could be seen as careless. You could also end up giving your employees too much leeway in how they code, and suddenly you have vulnerabilities you could have prevented. You have become careless again. Every person, team of people, and developer has a tendency to lean toward one of these choices. I believe finding some sort of balance everyone can live with is the ultimate challenge of character for a developer.
